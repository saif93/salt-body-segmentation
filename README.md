This repository contains the code and Jupyter Notebooks associated with our research paper titled "...". 

# Getting Started
The code is provided in Jupyter Notebook format and can be easily executed using Kaggle Notebooks. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the experiments.

## Steps to Execute
<ul><li>Upload the Jupyter Notebooks to Kaggle</li>
<li>Create or log in to your Kaggle account.</li>
<li>Start a new notebook environment.</li>
<li>Upload the notebooks from this repository.</li>
<li>Add Dataset</li>
<li>In the notebook environment, click the Add Dataset option.</li>
<li>Search for and add the dataset "TGS Salt Identification Challenge" to ensure the required data is available.</li>
<li>Run the Code</li>
</ul>

Follow the instructions in the notebooks to train, validate, and evaluate the models discussed in the paper.

# Repository Highlights
Implementation of Unet and LinkNet architectures with various pretrained encoders such as EfficientNetb7 and Xception.
Fully reproducible experiments with detailed explanations for each step.
Results aligned with the findings reported in our paper.

# Why This Matters
According to prior research, only 10% of studies on salt body segmentation since 2019 have shared their code, posing challenges in ensuring transparency and reproducibility. By making our code publicly available, we aim to foster collaboration and advance research in this domain.
